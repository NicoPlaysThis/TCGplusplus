# TCG++

This Chrome extension was developed based on my own Pokémon card collecting and some things I wanted to see improved.

Notably:
- Dark mode
- Grid buttons

I'm trying to collect every card and put them in order. A new grid feature makes it clearer where each card should go in my sleeves. This supports 2x2 and 3x3 card sleeves.

## Privacy

This extension is very minimal. The source code is published here. It does not make any changes to user data nor does it collect it.
